SPW-AzureGlobalNetHub

Project Overview:
"SPW-AzureGlobalNetHub" is a hands-on project focused on deploying a globally peered network using Microsoft Azure. This project demonstrates the use of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for efficient deployment and configuration of Azure resources, including Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), autoscaling, and load balancing.

Objectives:
Deploy and manage a globally peered network in Azure.
Implement load balancing and autoscaling to optimize resource utilization.
Showcase Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using ARM templates.
Develop a cost-effective strategy for resource allocation and deallocation.

Technologies Used:
Microsoft Azure PAYG Subscription
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates
Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
Azure Load Balancer

Repository Structure:
