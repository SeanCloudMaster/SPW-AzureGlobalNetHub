Azure Project Epimoni

Project Overview:
"Epimoni" is a hands-on project focused on deploying a globally peered network using Microsoft Azure. This project demonstrates the use of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for efficient deployment and configuration of Azure resources, including Network infrastructure, Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), autoscaling, and load balancing.

Objectives:
Deploy and manage a globally peered network in Azure.
Implement load balancing and autoscaling to optimize resource utilization.
Showcase Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using ARM templates.
Develop a cost-effective strategy for resource allocation and deallocation.

Technologies Used:
Microsoft Azure PAYG Subscription
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates
Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
Azure Load Balancer

Repository Structure:
/docs - Project documentation including scope and outline
/scripts - ARM templates and automation scripts
/images - Diagrams and screenshots
/templates - ARM and Bicep templates used for resource deployments

Getting Started:

Progress and Updates:
Completed initial setup of network infrastructure using ARM templates (VNets, Subnets, NSGs, Local Peering, Global Peering, etc.)


Challenges and Learnings:
Establishing VNet Peering locally and globally within JSON templates
Learning to "nest" templates
Creating a script to deploy ARM templates in a specific order (due to dependencies)

Future Enhancements:
Storage, Compute, and Security resources to be configured
